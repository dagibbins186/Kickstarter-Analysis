# Project Overview: An Analysis of a Kickstarter Campaign
This analysis was done for a client who wanted to understand how kickstarters are supporting theater. An analysis of 4,141 kickstarters across 21 countries suggests that successful outcomes happen most often for  music and theater.

# Results
![Category and Outcomes Across Countries.png](https://github.com/dagibbins186/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter%20Graphs/Category%20and%20Outcome%20Across%20Countries.png)\
The chart "Category and Outcome Across Countries" shows the outcomes of different categories. Music and theater had the most successes. While 493 theater kickstarters failed, this respresented only 35% of the all theater kickstarters. Proportionally, theater did the same or better than all the categories except music. Less than 1 out of 5 music kickstarters failed.\

The chart "Category and Outcome in Great Britain" delves into a specific market. Amost 3 out of every 4 theater kickstarters succeeded in Great Britian. Theater also had the most investment with 359 total kickstarters; about 7x more thany other category, including music.\

The chart "Subcategory and Outcome Across Great Britain" reveals that the subcategory, play, does particularly well in the genre of theater. For the entrepreneur who wants to invest in theater, Great Britain's play market holds promise. Unlike the US, where 61% of kickstarters succeeded for plays, 78% of kickstarters succeeded in Great Britain for plays. In Great Britain, among successful theater kickstarters, the average fundraising goal was $2,204. Pledges surpassed these goals with an average of $2,549. A T-Test indicates the difference between these averages is not due to chance.

Above, figure A expounds upon the success of plays by looking at theater reviews in Edinburgh, the second largest financial centre in Great Britain. Among 5 plays ("Be Prepared", "Checkpoint 22", "Cutting off Kate Bush", "Jestia and Raedon", "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Family"), the median pledge was $2,020 while the median goal was $2,000. Reviews commonly highlighted one man shows, comedy, love and loss. While more qualitative analysis is needed to draw firm conclusions, well-reviewed plays seem to draw pledges.\

The chart "Distribution of Goals and Pledges for Musicals in Great Britain" exemplifies that that the subcategory of theater matters. The orange box represents the distribution of pledges for musicals while the blue box represents the distribution of goals for musicals. The pledged box indicates that 25% of musicals receive no pledges. Three quarters of pledges fell almost 4x short of their goals. While an occasional large pledge was given, it was often far outside the masses for pledges. Music kickstarters may receive success across countries; however, this success does not appear to translate to musical kickstarters in Great Britain.\
![Outcomes_Based_on_Goals.png](https://github.com/dagibbins186/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter%20Graphs/Outcomes_Based_on_Goals.png)\
The chart "Outcomes Based on Goals" looks at the percentage of successful outcomes based on the dollar-goal for the kickstarter. Goals of less than $1,000 led to the most successful outcomes. Successful outcomes dropped precipitously when goals were set over $40,000. The larger the goal the more often the event was canceled.\
![Outcome_Based_on_Launch_Date](https://github.com/dagibbins186/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter%20Graphs/Outcome_Based_on_Launch_Date.png)\
The chart "Outcome Based on Launch Date" displays the outcomes of theater kickstarters over years, across all countries. Quarter 2 (Q2) consistently fared better than Quarter 1 (Q1), Quarter 3 (Q3) or Quarter 4 (Q4). In Q2, 282 (65%) kickstarters took place successfuly versus 156 (56%) kickstarters in Q4. Whereas failed and canceled theater kickstarters stayed steady across the year, successful kickstarters had improved outcomes based on the time of the year.

# Summary
<p> In conclusion, the following is recommended to achieve kickstarter success: </p>
<p> 1. Focus kickstarters on theater in Great Britain <p/>
<p> 2. Consider plays versus musicals <p/>
<p> 3. Time kickstarters to occur during Q2 <p/P
<p> 4. Watch reviews, as this could influence play's branding and investor's interest <p/>

Overall, the data was clean but some iferror formulas were applied to prevent indiscriminate measures. The data is limited by those values that were missing. Some issues were overcome by changing the data type. For instance, one column gave 'seconds that had passed since a kickstarter event'. This was turned into the 'date of last kickstarter event'. Changing the data type helped to better comprehend the results. Future data-extraction and analysis may wish to include Cities. This could help to explain the success or failure of goals in another meaningful way.
