The chart "Subcategory and Outcome Across Great Britain" reveals the subcategory, play, does particularly well in the genre of theater.

In Great Britain, among successful theater kickstarters, the average fundraising goal was $2,204. Pledges surpassed these goals with an average of $2,549. A T-Test indicates the difference between these averages is not due to chance.

Above, figure A expounds upon the success of plays in Great Britain by looking at theater reviews in Edinburgh, the second largest financial centre in Great Britain. Among 5 plays ("Be Prepared", "Checkpoint 22", "Cutting off Kate Bush", "Jestia and Raedon", "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Family"), the median pledge was $2,020 while the median goal was $2,000.

The orange box represents the distribution of pledges for musicals while the blue box represents the distribution of goals for musicals. The pledged box indicates that 25% of musicals receive no pledges. Three quarters of pledges fall almost 4x short of their goals. While an occasional large pledge is given, it is often far outside the masses of pledges.
